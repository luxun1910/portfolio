## Introduction

I'm embarrassed to say that I have hardly touched cloud computing at all.
At my previous job, most of the environment was on-premises, and I had the impression that cloud computing was expensive, so I couldn't bring myself to try it.
The only time I experienced AWS was when I participated in a hands-on session that AWS sales representatives conducted as part of their business outreach at my previous company.

However, nowadays, companies of all kinds are developing using cloud computing in some way or another.
As someone who calls themselves an engineer, staying in a state of complete ignorance about cloud computing could potentially affect my future career.
More than anything, "it would be a waste to end without understanding."
(The author is a fan of "Haikyu!!")

So, I made up my mind to learn about cloud computing.

## Why I Decided to Learn AWS

When I was thinking about which type of cloud to learn among the various options available, AWS was what intuitively came to mind.
Actually, while it's true that its global market share has been gradually declining, AWS still accounts for 29% of cloud usage worldwide, which remains the number one position.

A large market share means there's that much demand in the market.
Since it's not immediately necessary for my current work, I came to the conclusion that I should learn AWS, which has the largest market share.

## How to Learn? â†’ There's Something Called AWS Beginner Hands-on

Now that I had decided to learn AWS, how should I go about learning it? I searched around for various options.
Then I found an article titled ["For AWS Beginners: AWS Learning Methods Summary [Achievable in 15 Hours]"](https://qiita.com/toma_shohei/items/b7a001d26bd988d52021).
In this article, "AWS Beginner Hands-on" was introduced - a video-format hands-on learning material provided by AWS officially, and it was free.

Since it's provided by the official source and is free, I thought this would be the best approach, so I decided to try this first.
Rather than just watching videos and practicing the hands-on exercises, I'll also create output while I'm at it.

## Conclusion

By writing this kind of article on the vast ocean of the internet, I hereby pledge to face cloud computing seriously without slacking off!
