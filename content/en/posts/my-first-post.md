## Introduction

Nice to meet you, my name is luxun1910.
The pronunciation sounds like "lou shun"
The name is derived from the famous Chinese novelist “Lu Xun”.

I am currently studying abroad in China to learn Chinese.
After graduation, I would like to work as a software engineer, which was my original job title.
I thought it would be better to have a website where I can visualize my activities, so I have set up a portfolio and technical blog using Hugo and GitHub Pages.

Thank you.
