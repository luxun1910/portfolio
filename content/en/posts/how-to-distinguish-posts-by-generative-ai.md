## Introduction

Since the late 2020s, the internet has been flooded with AI-generated content. While convenient, it’s becoming harder to tell whether what you’re reading was written by a human.  
Let's explore how you can recognize an AI-written article.

---

## Sign 1: Vague but Positive-Sounding Statements

AI tends to avoid controversy, using abstract and safe phrases like
**"It's important to strike a balance,"** or **"We should be mindful of our choices."**  
It often sounds like a motivational poster or a school ethics textbook.

---

## Sign 2: Overly Structured Format

Human writing often meanders or digresses. In contrast, AI-generated articles follow a perfect **headline → subheading → conclusion** structure.  
It's neat—maybe *too* neat—like reading PowerPoint slides.

---

## Sign 3: Excessive Helpfulness

Phrases like **"To summarize," "The key takeaway is..."** show up frequently. AI wants to guide you through the logic step by step, but the excessive clarity can feel oddly unnatural.

---

## Sign 4: Lack of Firsthand Information

AI can only generate content based on its training data. It doesn’t conduct interviews or have lived experiences.  
So you’ll often find general statements like **"According to studies,"** or **"Many people feel that..."** but rarely find **firsthand observations or unique insights.**

---

## Sign 5: No Emotional Fluctuations

AI struggles with expressing **raw, inconsistent emotions**.  
You won’t find phrases like *"This pissed me off!"* or *"Honestly, I hesitated a lot..."* Instead, the tone remains calm, rational, and eerily consistent throughout.

---

## Sign 6: Untraceable Claims

Statements like **"Experts say..."** or **"It is generally believed..."** are classic AI hedges. They shift responsibility without citing actual sources.

---

## Sign 7: Uniform Style with No Personality

AI-generated text is smooth but **lacks voice or individuality**.  
The tone doesn’t change, no slang or quirks appear, and it feels like it could have been written by anyone—or no one.

---

## Conclusion

If you noticed this article was unusually structured, overly polite, and weirdly consistent—congratulations.  
**That's exactly how you recognize AI-generated content.**

And just to drive the point home: yes, this article was written by AI. Did you spot it from the start?
