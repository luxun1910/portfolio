      <description>Introduction Nice to meet you, my name is luxun1910. The pronunciation sounds like &amp;ldquo;lou shun&amp;rdquo; The name is derived from the famous Chinese novelist “Lu Xun”.&#xA;I am currently studying abroad in China to learn Chinese. After graduation, I would like to work as a software engineer, which was my original job title. I thought it would be better to have a website where I can visualize my activities, so I have set up a portfolio and technical blog using Hugo and GitHub Pages.</description>
