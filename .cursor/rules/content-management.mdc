# Content Management Guide

## Content Structure
Content for the portfolio is managed in the `content/` directory. Each content type follows specific conventions:

## Markdown Content
- Use markdown files (`.md`) for all content
- Front matter must be in YAML format
- Include appropriate metadata (title, date, description, etc.)

## Asset Management
- Place images in `static/images/`
- Use relative paths for image references
- Optimize images before adding to the repository

## Development Workflow
1. Create content in the appropriate directory
2. Test locally using `hugo server`
3. Commit changes following conventional commit messages
4. Push to trigger automatic deployment

## Quality Guidelines
- Follow [.textlintrc.json](mdc:.textlintrc.json) rules for content linting
- Ensure all links are valid
- Optimize images for web use
- Test responsiveness on multiple devices
